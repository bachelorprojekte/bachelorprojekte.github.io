We are Melvin, Florian and Marcus and we are working on improving the user experience regarding delays at Deutsche Bahn. We are working at [DB Systel](http://dbsystel.de), the internal IT service provider of Deutsche Bahn. We are developing an Android application (code name: “Renate”) and a backend supported by blockchain technologies to provide a better experience when a Deutsche Bahn customer experiences delays.
