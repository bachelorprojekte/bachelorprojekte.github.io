First of all the:image: openjdk:8-jdkvariables:  GRADLE_OPTS: \"-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false\"  ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK: \"26\"  ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS: \"27.0.3\"First of all we declare the image. We use openjdk:8-jdk, since it has Java and the JDK we need installed. It has Ubuntu 16.04 as OS.After that, we set a few variables. GRADLE_OPTS: \"-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false\" tells Gradle to not use the Gradle daemon in builds. The daemon is mainly used to cache some information between builds. Since GitLab CI uses fresh docker images at the start of every build to keep the build process isolated, there won’t be a chance for Gradle to cache stuff. Then we define the target SDK for this build and which build tools to use. Defining them here as variables saves us work if we want to update them later on.Let’s take a look at the before_script section now. This is run before every job of this build:before_script:  - apt-get -q --yes update  - apt-get -q --yes install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1  - wget -q http://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip -O linux-sdk-tools.zip  - mkdir linux-sdk-tools  - unzip -q linux-sdk-tools.zip -d linux-sdk-tools  - wget -q https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.6-bin.zip -O gradle.zip  - mkdir gradle  - unzip -q gradle.zip -d gradle  - chmod +x gradle/gradle-4.6/bin/gradle  - yes | linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses  - mkdir -p /root/.android  - touch /root/.android/repositories.cfg  - linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager --update &gt; update.log  - linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager \"platforms;android-${ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK}\" \"build-tools;${ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS}\" \"extras;google;m2repository\" \"extras;android;m2repository\" &gt; installPlatform.log  - export ANDROID_HOME=$PWD/linux-sdk-tools  - export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/linux-sdk-tools/platform-tools/Lets break it down into smaller parts.  - apt-get -q --yes update  - apt-get -q --yes install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1First of all, we update the system and install two packages, which are needed for the SDK tools to work.- wget -q http://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip -O linux-sdk-tools.zip- mkdir linux-sdk-tools- unzip -q linux-sdk-tools.zip -d linux-sdk-tools- wget -q https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.6-bin.zip -O gradle.zip- mkdir gradle- unzip -q gradle.zip -d gradle- chmod +x gradle/gradle-4.6/bin/gradle- yes | linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licensesThen we download and unzip the SDK tools and Gradle 4.6 for later usage. The apt version of gradle is currently bugged and won’t run the build correctly. We also accept the licenses for the SDKs. Without accepting the licenses, the sdkmanager won’t download or update the SDKs.- mkdir -p /root/.android- touch /root/.android/repositories.cfg- linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager --update &gt; update.log- linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager \"platforms;android-${ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK}\" \"build-tools;${ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS}\" \"extras;google;m2repository\" \"extras;android;m2repository\" &gt; installPlatform.log- export ANDROID_HOME=$PWD/linux-sdk-tools- export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/linux-sdk-tools/platform-tools/When updating, the sdkmanager will look for ~/.android/repositories.cfg. Since the docker image runs as a root, this file is located at /root/.android/repositories.cfg. We then update existing SDKs and install the platform and build tools for android.stages:  - assemble  - test  - qaWe got three stages so far, assemble, test and qa. While assembling, the apk is built. In the test stage we run unit and instrumental tests. The quality assurance stage currently only runs lint, but in the future we plan on using more Static Code Analysis tools like FindBugs, PMD or Checkstyle.buildApp:  stage: assemble  script:    - cd android    - ../gradle/gradle-4.6/bin/gradle assemble  artifacts:    paths:      - android/app/build/outputs/The only job in the assemble stage is buildApp. It enters the android folder, because that is our root for the android project. We have some more things in the repository, that’s why the android project is not at the root path. Then we basically just run gradle assemble to build the apk. Since android is the root for our android app, the output artifacts are at android/app/build/outputs/. This will later on be used as dependency for the tests.unitTests:  stage: test  dependencies:    - buildApp  script:    - cd android    - ../gradle/gradle-4.6/bin/gradle test  artifacts:    name: \"report-unit-tests_${CI_PROJECT_NAME}_${CI_BUILD_REF_NAME}\"    when: on_failure    expire_in: 4 days    paths:      - android/app/build/reports/tests/The unitTests job runs all unit tests. It depends on the buildApp job’s artifacts (which will be downloaded by this job and put in the same structure they were created previously). Similar to the previous job, it simply runs gradle test in the android project root. This job only uploads artifacts in case of failure, since that is the only case we need to look at them, and these reports will only be available for four days.instrumentalTests:  stage: test  dependencies:    - buildApp  tags:    - do  script:    - cd android    - chmod +x android-wait-for-emulator    - ../linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/sdkmanager \"system-images;android-${ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK};google_apis;x86\"    - echo no | ../linux-sdk-tools/tools/bin/avdmanager create avd -n testAVD -k \"system-images;android-${ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK};google_apis;x86\"    - ../linux-sdk-tools/tools/emulator -avd testAVD -no-audio -no-window &amp;    - ./android-wait-for-emulator    - adb devices    - adb shell settings put global window_animation_scale 0 &amp;    - adb shell settings put global transition_animation_scale 0 &amp;    - adb shell settings put global animator_duration_scale 0 &amp;    - adb shell input keyevent 82 &amp;    - ../gradle/gradle-4.6/bin/gradle connectedAndroidTest    - adb -s testAVD emu kill  artifacts:    name: \"report-instrumental-tests_${CI_PROJECT_NAME}_{CI_BUILD_REF_NAME}\"    when: on_failure    expire_in: 4 days    paths:      - android/app/build/reports/androidTests/The instrumentalTests job is a bit more complicated. First of all, it should only run on shared runners that have the do tag. Since the instrumental tests run on emulator the docker image needs to support KVM hardware acceleration. The only shared runners supporting KVM are the do tagged runner. android-wait-for-emulator is a script that waits for an emulator to be ready for usage. We then download the image for an x86 emulator with our target SDK and create and start an avd with that system image and wait until it has started. We then disable animations and transitions since those can interfere with instrumental tests. keyevent 82 unlocks the device, after which we run gradle connectedAndroidTest. This gradle task is only available (check with gradle tasks) if you have an emulator running or a device connected. Afterwards we stop the emulator and, as with the unit tests, upload the reports in case of failure, which expire after four days.lint:  stage: qa  dependencies:    - buildApp  script:    - cd android    - ../gradle/gradle-4.6/bin/gradle lint  artifacts:    name: \"reports_${CI_PROJECT_NAME}_${CI_BUILD_REF_NAME}.html\"    expire_in: 4 days    paths:      - android/app/build/reports/This runs lint. Basically it runs gradle lint and uploads the reports. Since lint also has warnings that do not fail the build, we always want to have the report.And that’s all we have so far. The next steps we want to take are running the build with caching, as well as implementing more static code analysis tools and making them visible in the repository.",

Developers from many companies and backgrounds contribute to the code base. The hope is that this leads to higher quality, more secure and long maintained code. Most importantly the goal is developing the code in a trustworthy way. Since these blockchain technologies aim to fulfill their function at the core of enterprises this is of tremendous importance.different frameworksThere are Burrow, Fabric, Iroha, Sawtooth and Indy. They overlap in some ways but each one offers unique features.modulesHyperledger Cello is a toolkit to provision and maintain Hyperledger networks.Hyperledger Explorer is a tool to visualize blockchain operations.Hyperledger Composer is a framework to accelerate the developement of applications on top of Hyperledger Fabric starting from business level (modeling network assets, participants and transactions). A very informative example application presentation can be found here.When does Hyperledger make sense?If you think of using a distributed ledger technology, you should think of an industry-wide approach from the earliest day. These are indicators in favor of using such a system:  There is a need for a shared common database  The parties involved with the process have conflicting incentives, or do not have trust among participants  There are multiple parties involved or writers to a database  There are currently trusted third parties involved in the process that facilitate interactions between multiple parties who must trust the third party. This could include escrow services, data feed providers, licensing authorities, or a notary public  Cryptography is currently being used or should be used. Cryptography facilitates data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation  Data for a business process is being entered into many different databases along the lifecycle of the process. It is important that this data is consistent across all entities, and/or digitization of such a process is desired  There are uniform rules governing participants in the system  Decision making of the parties is transparent, rather than confidential  There is a need for an objective, immutable history or log of facts for parties’ reference  Transaction frequency does not exceed 10,000 transactions per secondBut be aware of these issues that indicate blockchain might be the wrong solution:  The process involves confidential data  The process stores a lot of static data, or the data is quite large  Rules of transactions change frequently  The use of external services to gather/store dataHow to determine if blockchain makes sense for your business (source)",

This means a job can produce files as output that will be stored and and can be directly linked to on the GitLab platform. Of course this is ideal for our LaTeX pipeline. Let’s take a look at the compile_pdf stage:compile_pdf:  stage: compile_pdf  before_script:    - rm -rf htmlcov  script:    - python3 scripts/pipeline_script.py run \"$GITLAB_USER_NAME\" $CI_JOB_ID \"$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)\" $GITLAB_USER_EMAIL $CI_PROJECT_URL  cache:    key: single_pdfs    paths:      - assignment_papers/latex_output      - letters/latex_output  artifacts:    paths:      - assignment_papers/*.pdf      - letters/*.pdf  only:    - masterFirst it executes the scripts/pipeline_script.py script. The necessary arguments are the GitLab variables $GITLAB_USER_NAME, $CI_JOB_ID, $GITLAB_USER_EMAIL and $CI_PROJECT_URL as well as the current commit message: $(git log -1 --pretty=%B). The executed scripts/pipeline_script.py will write all files resulting from document compilation to assignment_papers/latex_output/* and letters/latex_output/* and copy the PDFs to assignment_papers/*.pdf and `letters/*.pdf/.Setting the key cache results in all files specified under paths being cached between job runs given you’re using a dedicated GitLab runner. Alos it will speed up compilation because documents will only be recompiled if there’s a change. In our example case it reduced the runtime from 5 minutes to just 1 minute. Unfortunately the free shared runners on gitlab.com don’t allow this. But what about the job artifacts?The scripts/pipeline_script.py script will copy the resulting PDFs from foldername/latex_output/*pdf to foldername/*.pdf. This happens at the PIPELINE.move_pdfs() function call. Thus we specify under artifacts the paths where GitLab CI will look for matching files to store them as artifacts.Processing time without caching and with enabled caching.What does the script do?Ultimately after checking that the folder structures are compliant the script will execute the following lines in the scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py submodule:        for dir_name, data in second_level_items.items():            main_filename = dir_name + \".tex\"            folderpath = join(self.relative_path, dir_name)            cmd = ('cd \"{fp}\" &amp;&amp; latexmk -output-directory=../latex_output -pdf \"{f}\"'\\                \" -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -shell-escape %S/'\")\\                .format(fp=folderpath, f=main_filename)            if call(cmd, shell=True) == 0:                sccmsg = \"\\033[92mCompiled \\033[94m{d}.tex\\033[92m successfully\\033[0m\"\\                    .format(d=dir_name)                print(sccmsg)            else:                errmsg = \"\\033[91mError with compiling \\033[94m{d}.tex\\033[0m\\ncmd: {c}\"\\                    .format(d=dir_name, c=cmd)                self.error_notify_and_exit(errmsg)The dictionary second_level_items contains all but the exempted subfolders in a valid root subdirectory. Now all it does for a folder called documentfoldername residing in assignment_papers is executing these commands:cd documentfoldernamelatexmk -output-directory=../latex_output -pdf \"documentfoldername.tex\" -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -shell-escape %S/'After executing the script will print a success message. If the command fails it will notify about this and exit with an error so that the GitLab job will fail.Enforcing folder rulesThe script scripts/pipeline_script.py enforces a folder structure like this:.|+--assignment_papers|  +--documentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.png|  |  +--documentfoldername.tex|  |  +--preamble.tex|  |  +--content.tex|  +--otherdocumentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.pdf|  |  +--otherdocumentfoldername.tex|  |  +--preamble.tex|  |  +--content.tex+--letters|  +--documentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.jpg|  |  +--documentfoldername.tex|  +--otherdocumentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.jpg|  |  +--otherdocumentfoldername.tex  there can be multiple folders the root directory          assignment_papers                  subfolders must contain .tex files with the same name          subfolders must contain preamble.tex file          subfolders must contain content.tex file          subfolders may contain a figures folder                    letters                  subfolders must contain .tex files with the same name          subfolders may contain a figures folder                    These rules are determined in the scripts/pipeline_script.py in the FOLDER_STRUCTURES dictionary. It maps the root level subfolder names to folder structure rules formatted as dictionaries. For example if a subfolders name begins with a string in the list referenced by the \"exempt_dirs_start_with\" key it will be exempted from being processed by the pipeline.#root level directories we won't processEXEMPT_DIRS = [\"scripts\", \"__pycache__\"]#dirs starting with given string in LateXPipeline.relative_path will be ignored#also applied to root level dirsEXEMPT_DIRS_START_WITH = [\".\"]#files mandatory in each LaTeX folderMANDATORY_FILES_ASSIGNMENT = [\"preamble.tex\", \"references.bib\", \"content.tex\"]#directories in LateXPipeline.relative_path the pipeline will ignoreEXEMPT_DIRS_ASSIGNMENT = [\"latex_output\", \"BP_COMBINED\", \"__pycache__\"]#folders allowed but not mandatory in subdirectoriesALLOWED_SUBDIRS = [\"figures\"]#allowed folder structure for folder assignment_papersFOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT = {\"exempt_dirs\": EXEMPT_DIRS_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"exempt_dirs_start_with\": EXEMPT_DIRS_START_WITH,\\    \"mandatory_files\": MANDATORY_FILES_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"allowed_subdirs\": ALLOWED_SUBDIRS}#allowed folder structure for folder lettersFOLDER_STRUCTURE_LETTERS = dict(FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT)FOLDER_STRUCTURE_LETTERS[\"mandatory_files\"] = []#different folder structures for each root level dir#test_root_folder(_one/two) is necessary for pytest testingFOLDER_STRUCTURES = {\"test_root_folder\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"test_script_root_folder\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"test_folder_one\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT, \"test_folder_two\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"assignment_papers\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT, \"letters\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_LETTERS}Known issuesThere is still a problem with calculating the code coverage. As seen in the current example repo  the displayed code coverage is just about 80% when it should be very close to 100 percent. Unfortunately the tests in scripts/tests/test_latexpipeline.py calling the script with subprocess.run won’t be measured by codecov:def test_console_test_usage(self):     \"\"\"Check that Latexmk actually works and the module can be invoked as script from command line\"\"\"     ret = subprocess.run(\"python3 \" + RELATIVE_SCRIPT_PATH + ' test test@test.de \"Test --meta lol\"',\\         shell=True, cwd=SCRIPT_TEST_ROOT_DIR_PATH, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)     print(ret.stderr)     assert b\"YAY\" in ret.stdout     assert b\"Latexmk\" in ret.stderr",
