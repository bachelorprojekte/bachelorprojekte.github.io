<p>Revision 1: Dec. 2, 1987 by Joe Talmadge</p>
<p>In the time I have been posting to net, I have encountered flame wars of epic proportions (Brahms Gang vs. Tim Maroney), and flame wars of a more modest nature (MIT vs. CIT). Flaming has evolved into a highly-stylized art form, complete with unwritten rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>Here, I have attempted to document the Art of Flaming, in such a way as it will be interesting to old hands (flame masters) and novices (virgins) alike. Without a further ado, then, I present:</p><!--more-->
<p><strong>The twelve commandments of flaming</strong></p>
<ol><li>Make things up about your opponent: It&rsquo;s important to make your lies sound true. Preface your argument with the word &ldquo;clearly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Clearly, Fred Flooney is a liar, and a dirtball to boot.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Be an armchair psychologist: You&rsquo;re a smart person. You&rsquo;ve heard of Freud. You took a psychology course in college. Clearly, you&rsquo;re qualified to psychoanalyze your opponent. &ldquo;Polly Purebread, by using the word &lsquo;zucchini&rsquo; in her posting, shows she has a bad case of penis envy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Cross-post your flames: Everyone on the net is just waiting for the next literary masterpiece to leave your terminal. From rec.arts.wobegon to alt.gourmand, they&rsquo;re all holding their breaths until your next flame. Therefore, post everywhere.</li>
<li>Conspiracies abound: If everyone&rsquo;s against you, the reason can&rsquo;t possiblybe that you&rsquo;re a fuckhead. There&rsquo;s obviously a conspiracy against you, and you will be doing the entire net a favor by exposing it.</li>
<li>Lawsuit threats: This is the reverse of Rule #4 (sort of like the Yin &amp; Yang of flaming). Threatening a lawsuit is always considered to be in good form. &ldquo;By saying that I&rsquo;ve posted to the wrong group, Bertha has libeled me, slandered me, and sodomized me. See you in court, Bertha.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Force them to document their claims: Even if Harry Hoinkus states outright that he likes tomato sauce on his pasta, you should demand documentation. If Newsweek hasn&rsquo;t written an article on Harry&rsquo;s pasta preferences, then Harry&rsquo;s obviously lying.</li>
<li>Use foreign phrases: French is good, but Latin is the lingua franca of flaming. You should use the words &ldquo;ad hominem&rdquo; at least three times per article. Other favorite Latin phrases are &ldquo;ad nauseum,&rdquo; &ldquo;vini, vidi, vici,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fetuccini alfredo.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tell 'em how smart you are: Why use intelligent arguments to convince them you&rsquo;re smart when all you have to do is tell them? State that you&rsquo;re a member of Mensa or Mega or Dorks of America. Tell them the scores you received on every exam since high school. &ldquo;I got an 800 on my SATs, LSATs, GREs, MCATs, and I can also spell the word 'premeiotic&rsquo; .&rdquo;</li>
<li>Accuse your opponent of censorship. It is your right as an American citizen to post whatever the hell you want to the net (as guaranteed by the 37th Amendment, I think). Anyone who tries to limit your cross-posting or move a flame war to email is either a communist, a fascist, or both.</li>
<li>Doubt their existence: You&rsquo;ve never actually seen your opponent, have you? And since you&rsquo;re the center of the universe, you should have seen them by now, shouldn&rsquo;t you? Therefore, THEY DON&rsquo;T EXIST! This is the beauty of flamers&rsquo; logic.</li>
<li>Lie, cheat, steal, leave the toilet seat up.</li>
<li>When in doubt, insult: If you forget the other 11 rules, remember this one. At some point during your wonderful career as a flamer you will undoubtedly end up in a flame war with someone who is better than you. This person will expose your lies, tear apart your arguments, make you look generally like a bozo. At this point, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do: insult the dirtbag!!! &ldquo;Oh yeah? Well, your mother does strange things with vegetables.&rdquo;</li>
</ol><h4>The Golden Rule of Flaming</h4>
<p>My flames will be witty, insulting, interesting, funny, caustic, or sarcastic, but never, ever, will they be boring.</p>
<p>Here endeth the scriptures.</p>
